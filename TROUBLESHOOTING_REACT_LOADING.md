# 🔧 FluxSEO React Loading Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Issue Fixed!

The React loading issues you encountered have been **FIXED** in the latest version. Here's what was wrong and how it's been resolved:

## ❌ What Was Wrong

1. **Dynamic Script Loading Conflict**: The React loader was trying to dynamically load the WordPress app script, but it was already being loaded by WordPress enqueue system
2. **Incorrect File Paths**: Script was looking for files in wrong directory (missing `/dist/` path)
3. **Script Loading Order**: Dependencies weren't properly ordered
4. **Complex Initialization**: Too many moving parts causing conflicts

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

1. **Simplified React Loader**: Removed dynamic script loading, now just initializes existing scripts
2. **Fixed File Paths**: All scripts now load from correct `/dist/` directory
3. **Proper Dependencies**: Script loading order fixed in WordPress enqueue system
4. **Streamlined Initialization**: Single, simple initialization process
